The game follows these core mechanics:

2. A timer starts when the first card is flipped
3. Two cards can be flipped at a time
4. If the two cards match, they remain face up
5. If they don't match, they flip back face down
6. The game is won when all pairs are matched
7. Time and move count are tracked for scoring
